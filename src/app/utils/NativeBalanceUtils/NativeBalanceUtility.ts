/**SendTransaction can be used to send Ether/BNB Coin from one Ethereum address /BNB wallet to another.

/**When we want to perform a transaction on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) (e.g., sending tokens, interacting with a 
 * smart contract) then the network requires a small fee called gas fee.

‚úÖ BNB is used to pay this gas fee.

Example
Imagine we want to send Vote Tokens to someone:

Our wallet has Vote Tokens ‚úÖ
Our wallet has 0 BNB ‚ùå
üëâ Transaction will fail because we don‚Äôt have BNB(Binance Coin or Native Coin or Native balance) to pay the gas fee.

Key Point
Even if we're sending tokens (not BNB itself), we still need BNB for the transaction to process.

üí° Think of BNB like fuel (petrol) for a car‚Äîwithout fuel, the car (our transaction) won't move. üöóüí® */

/**. What is Wei and Why Convert BNB to Wei?
It is the smallest unit of currency (BNB or ether) is called Wei.

In blockchain networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BNB), 
1 Ether (ETH) = 1 BNB = 10¬π‚Å∏ Wei

(Wei is similar to cents in USD or paisa in PKR, but much smaller (1 Wei = 0.000000000000000001 BNB) ) */

/*Why is This Necessary?
Blockchain transactions require exact precision, so they always work in Wei (the smallest unit).
If we send 0.03 BNB without converting to Wei, Web3 might misinterpret the value or cause decimal precision errors.*/
